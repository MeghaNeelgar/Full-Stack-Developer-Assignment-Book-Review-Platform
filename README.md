# Full-Stack-Developer-Assignment-Book-Review-Platform
Develop a book review platform where users can browse books, read and write reviews, and rate books. The application should have a React frontend and a Node.js backend using Express and SQL/MongoDB.
 Additional Notes:

Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.

Update .env with proper MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET before running the backend.

The frontend communicates with the backend at http://localhost:5000.
